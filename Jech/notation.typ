== Notation
  This document uses the following conventions:
  -
    $A subset B$ denotes that $A$ is a _proper_ subset of $B$.
  -
    The power set of $X$ is denoted $cal(P)(X)$
  -
    The von Neumann ordinal ${m in NN mid(|) m < n}$ of $n in NN$ may be explicitly denoted $[|n|]$, though set-theoretically, $n = [|n|]$.
